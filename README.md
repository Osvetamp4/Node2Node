 An application I built with two other friends to showcase a custom path finding algorithm with a graphical interface.


 The original idea behind the algorithm came from a friend when we were playing on a mincraft world together. We had an entire minecart rail system in place and we were wondering how to direct the minecarts such that they would reach their destination in the shortest time possible. With that train of thought, my friend told me to look up graph theory.

 I did and it let me down a rabbit hole of graphcs, verticies, edges, and all sorts of theorems and different formats to represent graphs.

 This intrigued me so much that I decided to try and build my very own custom path finding algorithm. I took inspiration from another friend's project where he made an algorithm to generate mazes with snakes. I used that same approach to generate all possible paths and finding the shortest one out of all them with these "snakes". 

 This is the end result that I used to then enter into the Hackkean 2022 hackathon:
